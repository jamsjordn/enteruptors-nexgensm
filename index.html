				<p>In every organisation, core business systems don't cover 100% of the functions of the business.
					Workarounds are built to cover the many manual processes and spreadsheets. Businesses intend to
					replace workarounds with full business systems, but these projects get put on the backburner.</p>
				<p>These points of failure expose your business to compliance breaches, frauds, risk exposures and risks
					from errors.</p>
				<p>We give business leaders certainty around risk & compliance to reduce compliance costs, increase
					productivity and add value by providing decision intelligence. Improving outcomes, cutting costs and
					increasing productivity by driving quality in risk and compliance.</p>
				<p>We are achieving this through structured knowledge working and bringing order to the chaotic mess of
					workarounds.</p>
				<p>We rapidly build low-risk, low-cost apps to replace workarounds, united under one platform with a
					single source of truth and benefits including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Opening the data up to machine learning, artificial intelligence, decision intelligence</li>
					<li>Improving audit security and control</li>
					<li>Removing the need for reconciliation of data sources</li>
					<li>Reducing risk of error and omission</li>
					<li>Increase productivity around 50%</li>
					<li>Give executives certainty</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This is a universal issue and by replacing these workarounds with a proper system your business will
					solve a great number of its problems.</p>
